select count(*) from marketing_campaign
select count(distinct id)  from marketing_campaign mc 

2.How many customers accepted each of the five marketing campaigns?SELECT 
sum(mc.AcceptedCmp1 )as campaign1,
sum(mc.AcceptedCmp2 )as campaign2,
sum(mc.AcceptedCmp3 )as campaign3,
sum(mc.AcceptedCmp4 )as campaign4,
sum(mc.AcceptedCmp5 )as campaign5
from marketing_campaign mc 
--------------------
3.What is the overall acceptance rate across all marketing campaigns?

SELECT 
sum(mc.AcceptedCmp1 )+
sum(mc.AcceptedCmp2 )+sum(mc.AcceptedCmp3 )+
sum(mc.AcceptedCmp4 )+
sum(mc.AcceptedCmp5 )+sum(mc.Response ) AS OverallAcceptanceRate
from marketing_campaign mc 

SELECT round( 100.0*(
sum(mc.AcceptedCmp1 )+
sum(mc.AcceptedCmp2 )+sum(mc.AcceptedCmp3 )+
sum(mc.AcceptedCmp4 )+
sum(mc.AcceptedCmp5 ))/(count(*)*5),2)
AS overall_acceptance_rate
from marketing_campaign mc 

Explanation:
SUM(...): counts how many times customers accepted each campaign.

COUNT(*) * 5: total number of opportunities (5 campaigns Ã— total customers).

The division gives the acceptance ratio, and multiplying by 100 gives it in percent.

ROUND(..., 2): rounds the result to 2 decimal places.
